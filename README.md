Forex Wars
==========

The year is 2027, the inevitable has happened; the Forex market has taken over the world economy. No longer do governments rule, but the Forex regulators control all aspects of trade, business and law.

Independant Forex trading has been banned.  Now all trading is done through the mighty Forex regulators themselves.

The most recent conflict has seen the Forex geography reduce down into two opposing forces, the CanAm Consortium controlled by IIROC and the Eurasian League controlled by MAS.  All other regulators have been obliterated by these two juggernauts.

You are the newest recruit to graduate the Forex boot camp at Fort OANDA, and are now fighting in the trenches of the currency wars to protect your way of life.

Be ever vigilant for price attacks from your opposition.  You can never rest, Forex happens 24 hours a day (but hey, you do get weekends off).

Buy low, sell high, and win the Forex Wars!
